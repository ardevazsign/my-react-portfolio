    "Greetings! As a recent graduate from a coding Bootcamp, I've developed a strong foundation in web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js.

I've had the opportunity to collaborate with talented classmates on a group project during my Bootcamp, where I contributed significantly to the development process and learned the importance of teamwork and effective communication.
